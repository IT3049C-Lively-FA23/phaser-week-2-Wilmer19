## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I believe I deserve a 20/20 because I followed along with the tutorial and my game is working. The only issue 
I ran into was that the original assets were not available. This sparked an idea and I decided to change 
the theme of the game. It's the same concept but now it's a dog playing fetch. I changed the background
color to green, changed the title to "Fetch" and used spirte images of a dog and tennis ball.

## Self-Reflection:
Even though I created a game using a tutorial, I'm proud that I made it unique. The game is 
very simple but I believe any animal lover would appericiate playing it. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
1 hour
